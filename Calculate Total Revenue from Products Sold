#3. Calculate Total Revenue from Products Sold
(A store sells 4 types of products. The quantity sold and the price per unit are stored as 
NumPy arrays: 
quantities = np.array([10, 15, 7, 20])  # Number of units sold 
prices = np.array([50, 40, 100, 30])    
# Price per unit)


import numpy as np

quantities = np.array([10,15,7,20])
prices = np.array([50,40,100,30])

total_revenue = np.dot(quantities, prices)
print("Total Revenue :", total_revenue)
