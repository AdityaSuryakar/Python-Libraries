#2. Reshape a 1D Array into a 2D Matrix 
( A company's quarterly sales data is stored in a 1D NumPy array: [1000, 1200, 1500, 
1800, 2000, 2100, 2500, 2700]. Convert it into a 2D array with 4 rows and 2 columns 
representing sales per quarter.) 

import numpy as np

#1D NumPy Array
a = np.array([1000,1200,1500,1800,2000,2100,2500,2700])
print(a)

#2D Array - 4 Rows and 2 Columns
print("2D Array:",a.reshape(4,-1))
