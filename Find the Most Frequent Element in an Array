#5. Find the Most Frequent Element in an Array 
(Given a NumPy array [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4], determine which element 
appears the most times. )

import numpy as np
from collections import Counter

arr = np.array([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4,4])
counts = Counter(arr)
most_frequent = counts.most_common()  

print("Most Frequent Element:", most_frequent[0][0])
print("Number of Occurrences:", most_frequent[0][1])
